# Advance_Wars_Hack
Custom Levels of Advance Wars 2

This an older project from before I had some of my current best practices, more specifically version control.
For that reason, for multiple missions ONLY that mission works, and you need a corresponding save file
to go directly to that mission. Otherwise the game will crash (and scream at you).

Because thats not ideal for seeing what it is I've actually done, I have some screenshots of some finished maps,
so even if you cant play them, you can still see them, and I can remember what I thought when making them.
